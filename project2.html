            <p class="home-p">Hey, I'm Jaideep Thiruveedhi — a builder and future founder passionate about AI, finance, and tech innovation.

I'm pursuing Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at the Scaler School of Technology, alongside Data Science & Applications at IIT Madras — a combination that helps me solve real-world problems with both engineering rigor and data insight.

I'm deeply fascinated by High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and Fintech, and I have a few startup ideas I'm carefully preparing to launch at the right time.

I recently started a podcast. While my first videos focus on tech topics, I plan to explore a broader range of ideas in the future — from innovation to entrepreneurship. It's my way of learning from builders and sharing insights with the community.

Outside of tech, I enjoy cricket and draw inspiration from Indian mythology and puranas, which teach timeless lessons about leadership, discipline, and vision.

My goal is to become a tech-savvy entrepreneur and build ventures that bridge AI, finance, and impact. I also have a short term goal to get into Ivy Leagues for my MBA.

I believe in learning fast, experimenting boldly, and building relentlessly.</p>
